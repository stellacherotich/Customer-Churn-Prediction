### <b> Project Overview </b>
In this project I have utilised machine learning algorithms in order to identify any trends that can help in predicting whether a customer that is using SyriaTel will stop (churn) using the services. This is to help SyriaTel in their decision making process as well as in developing methods that might help to reduce the churn rate further.

## <b> Business Understanding </b>
### <b> Business Problem </b>
- Who is SyriaTel?
- Customer retention rate is key in the telecommunication domain 
- Important to know what features are leading to churn rate increase 
- What are the potential factors for churn?

#### <b>Objectives</b>
As the data scientist assigned to this project, what are your objectives?
1. Identify if there are certain features that can predict whether a customer will churn or not
2. Predict as accurately as possible using a model, whether a customer will churn



#### <b> Metrics of Success </b>
In this model, the metrics of success are outlined as follows :


## <b> Data Understanding </b>
In conducting this analysis, the CRISP-DM data science process was used.
There were : Outline important notes based on the dataset... etc. etc.
